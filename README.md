Split 40% Bluetooth Keyboard

### Motivation
I wanted a portable, light keyboard to bring to class, with stenography (chording) and bluetooth capabilities.

### Design
- symmetrical design so both sides of the PCB can be soldered to get the left and right halves
  - JLCPCB minimum order quantity is 5, so might as well use 2/5 instead of buying 2 different PCBs and using 2/10
- choc low profile switches for portability
- nice!nano for easy hand soldering (as opposed to soldering my own MCUs)
- thumb switches as close together as possible for chording
- rotary encoder for alt-tab on the left, volume on the right
- ports for oled display (not recommended because of battery drain)
  - mounting holes for acrylic screen protector
- pads for ws2812b leds (not recommended because of battery drain)
